    <string name="neera">NIRA is a new fintech business seeking to address the issue of access to credit for consumers
in India. With banks relying predominantly on CIBIL scores and collateral pledged against
loans, less than 10% of Indians are able to get loans through the formal sector. Thus, most
people are forced to use informal channels when they need finance.
        \n \n
In todays digital age, users are creating large amounts of information about themselves
through their activity on their smartphones and online. By combining these news types of
data with traditional sources used to assess borrowers (bank statement etc.) we can now
score these previously unscored borrowers. If a borrowers score is sufficiently high on our
proprietary model, we can offer them credit.
        \n \n
We are reimagining the way loans are underwritten and bring access to credit to millions of
underbanked in India. We can economically empower them to have greater control of their
lives and provide downside protection in difficult times. We are addressing head-on a big
challenge. Its also a great opportunity from both a commercial and societal impact
perspective.</string>
